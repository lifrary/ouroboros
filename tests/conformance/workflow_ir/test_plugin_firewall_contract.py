"""Plugin firewall contract fixture (read-only, harness-side).

This test exists at the #939 / #956 boundary. It does NOT change plugin
dispatch behavior (which lives on #939) and does NOT introduce a new event
family. It locks ONE invariant the conformance harness depends on:

    A plugin invocation that is blocked at the permission gate
    cannot be projected as a successful workflow-node completion.

Concretely:

  * ``invoke_plugin`` MUST return ``status="blocked"`` when a required
    permission is not trusted.
  * The blocked path MUST emit only ``plugin.failed`` with
    ``result.status == "blocked"``. It MUST NOT emit ``plugin.invoked``
    or ``plugin.completed``.
  * When a harness builds a Workflow IR lifecycle history from a blocked
    invocation, it cannot legally emit a ``workflow.node.completed`` for
    the plugin-owned node — only ``workflow.node.failed`` with a
    ``reason_code`` derived from the firewall's blocked outcome.

The test is offline-deterministic: a temporary plugin manifest is written
to ``tmp_path``, no network/cloud is touched, and the firewall is invoked
with no trust record so the blocked path is exercised by construction.
